## Hypermedia API Driven Web GUI

You should be designing your website on top of an API. Your API should use Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOS), because that technology provides a way to remove the unreliable part of making websites, and focus on the components that make a reliable and consistent experience.

## Hypermedia Drives the Web
Hypermedia driven APIs can take full advantage of the HTTP standards. These standards drive the web and standardize the experience users can expect. It provides a consistent groundwork to build working and reliable websites and services. With this high level of availability comes the ability to trust the web, and web sites that use this technology effectively.

## Designing a good API is just part of the process 
Even if you have the best APIs, you will never have an amazing and ingenius API until your rely solely on that API to expose your service, and that means building your entire website on top of your API. HyperionJS is designed to allow you to do just that.

#HyperionJS
HyperionJS is a javascript application that understands how to render a hypermedia API. HyperionJS currently supports the entirety of JSON Hyper Schema, as well as semantics interpretation of a small number of link relations.
